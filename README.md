# Program Codes
Academic Program information from NYS Department of Education for academic programs at Queens
College of CUNY.

The bash script program_codes.sh “scrapes” the NYS DOE website to extract information for all
Queens College programs, which it saves in a file that then serves as input to program_codes.py,
which generates an Excel spreadsheet with a structured view of each program.
